# Hjerte_Simple
A simple but informative version of Hjerte

Hjerte is the name of this heart failure detector.
It means "heart" in this beautiful language that is Norwegian. This word has the same origin than "heart" in English or "coeur" in French. It is a very old word that was born thousands years ago when the vast inlandsis that covered the North hemisphere, finally retreated and let humans start the neolithic revolution.

Hjerte run without modification, as it is in the file section, on a Raspberry Pi 3B.
This means there is no need to make a "C" version of this Java program, as the RP 3B, the case and the LCD touchscreen cost me only $90. If you add a microphone you are still below the $150 target price. A video will be provided soon.

So the end of the project is close now. A new version of the software is available at :
https://github.com/Hjertesvikt/Hjerte_Simple
I will only make quality control on this software for now.
