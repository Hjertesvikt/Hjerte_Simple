/**
 * This is the general strategy that was followed by winners in Physionet 2016:
 * 
 * We first need to get comparable sounds, so sounds must be downsample
 *     (in order to get the same rate for different sounds)
 *
 * Then we need a clean sound, so we remove spikes
 *
 * Then we use this information to time normalize the sound according to the beat rate
 * in order to minimize the HMM work
 *
 * Then we will segment it to recognize the significant times like the locations for
 * S1, systole, s2 and diastole 
 * Actually there are dozens of features that recognised in Physionet 2016, but they 
 * are common to the full sound file and not specific to some area. On contrary with HMMs
 * we need to segment precisely all the areas in the sound file.
